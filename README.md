The WORST Employee Tracker Application ever!

## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 12 Challenge - "12 SQL: Employee Tracker"

In order for my work to show what I can do, I used: Postgres SQL (PSQL), Node.js, and the Inquirer 8.2.4 package to complete the following User Story and A/C:

User Story: \
AS A business owner, I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company, SO THAT I can organize and plan my business.

Acceptance Criteria: \
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

## Usage

My final version of the work mirrors the UT Challenge source file/code, user story, acceptance criteria, and grading rubric.

## Credits

I usually credit Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own code without any impediments, on this one.

- <https://stackoverflow.com/>

- <https://www.taskade.com/>

- <https://google.com/>

- <https://bing.com/>

- <(https://claude.ai/new)> for troubleshooting and error handling, because I had a very hard time getting my code to work



I referenced code from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my node.js application.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was not able to succesfully deploy my application. :(.
